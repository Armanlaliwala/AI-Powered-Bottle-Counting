# 🚀 AI-Powered Bottle Counting Solution

## 🔍 Overview
This project is an **AI-powered bottle counting solution** that automates the process of detecting and counting bottles on a conveyor belt in **real-time**. Using a **YOLO-based object detection model**, the system ensures **high accuracy, scalability, and seamless integration** into manufacturing workflows.

## 🛠️ Features
- **Real-time object detection** using YOLO
- **Automated bottle tracking and counting**
- **Reduces manual errors** and increases efficiency
- **Scalable** for different production environments
- **Plug & Play solution** for easy deployment

## 📽️ Demo

## 📂 Project Structure
```
│── model/                 # YOLO model files
│── videos/                # Input video files
│── output/                # Processed output videos
│── bottle_counter.py      # Main script for detection and counting
│── README.md              # Project documentation
```

## 🔧 Installation & Setup
### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/bottle-counting-ai.git
cd bottle-counting-ai
```
### 2️⃣ Install Dependencies
Ensure you have Python installed, then run:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### 3️⃣ Run the Script
```bash
python bottle_counter.py
```

## 🏗️ How It Works
1. **Loads YOLO model** for real-time object detection.
2. **Processes video frames** and identifies bottle objects.
3. **Tracks and counts bottles** as they cross a predefined threshold.
4. **Displays results** with a real-time counter overlay.
5. **Saves output video** with detection results.

## 🔗 Technologies Used
- **Python**
